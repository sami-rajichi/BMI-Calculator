# BMI Calculator

This repository contains my first flutter project : **BMI Calculator** (It's been made for learning purposes)

What might make difference here, is that I integrate a customized [Radial Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/flutter-widgets/flutter-radial-gauge) widget (Built by [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com)). This widget lets you :
- Display numerical values and ranges on a radial scale.
- Customize a gauge to simulate a speedometer, temperature monitor, or dashboard.
- Use built-in animation and interactive pointers that can be dragged from one place to another.

## How to run BMI Calculator

- Open your CLI and type :
```
git clone https://github.com/sami-rajichi/Tic-Tac-Toe-GUI.git
```
**OR** 

- Download the repo by clicking on the `Code` button above, then click on download as `zip` and extract the `zip` file.

Lastly, jump in to the extracted folder, and open it with your preferred `IDE`.
